  <p>This is a lot of fun for the guests to take part in and leaves a fantastic memory of the wedding day. The couple choose a track (with guidance from us) for the guests to lip sync to. This
is organised on the day by our own choreographer and filmed by our cameraman. We try and do this in the afternoon but it can also be completed before the first dance.</p>

  <p>We have our own fully licenced drone pilot available to give a different perspective of your venue. We can get amazing aerial shots of extremely high quality and stability from a
range of different drones at our disposal. If appropriate we can also use the drone to film some truly unique and special shots of the bride and groom.</p>

  <h3>Same Day Edit</h3>
  <img src="/img/gladiator.jpeg" alt="My Gladiator" title="My Gladiator">
  <p>This is a great piece of entertainment for later in the evening, particularly if it&lsquo;s a small ceremony and there are a lot of evening guests. An edit is put together during the meal and early
evening and then shown on a large screen during the buffet break. This also means that the bride and groom walk away with a ten minute edit of their wedding at the end of the day.</p>

  <h3>Second Cameraman</h3>
  <img src="/img/beach.jpeg" alt="Filming on the beach" title="Filming on the beach">
  <p>An extra cameraman captures even more footage of the day to ensure that not a moment is missed. It also gives more dedicated footage. Whereas an unmanned camera will be set on a wide view to capture the panorama of the day, a manned camera can really focus in on the action.</p>
