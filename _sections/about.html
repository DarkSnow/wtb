  <p>Watch The Birdie opened in 2005 and since then we have produced over 400 beautiful wedding films, each one as unique as the wedding couple themselves. Since these early days, our work has taken us all over Scotland and as far afield as Dubai and Austria. Our work has been recognised in the industry by being <a href="http://www.vowsawards.co.uk/">VOWS</a> finalists in 2009, 2011 and 2015 and winners in 2009. We are also delighted to be recommended by many venues and photographers but we are most excited by the many recommendations we get from former wedding couples.</p>
  <p>Oh and why Watch The Birdie? In the early days of photography, to attract the subject, a photographer would carry a mechanical bird that chirped and the phrase &ldquo;watch the birdie&rdquo; became a command at portrait sessions.</p>

  <h3>Geoff Baxter &compfn; Owner of Watch The Birdie</h3>

  <p>I spent more than twenty years firstly as an illustrator at Ferranti and then headed up the Multimedia dept at BAE Systems, where we produced brochures and sales literature and also did all the in-house photography and video. Leaving in 2005, gave me the opportunity to put these years of experience to good use in setting up my own business. With a broad skills set I decided to follow the filmmaking route and it&lsquo;s been a fantastic experience.</p>
  <p>Being able to be the master of my own destiny is something I&lsquo;ve revelled in and I enjoy every minute! Being self employed, you tend to follow the path laid out ahead and that very quickly took me to specialise in weddings. Initially it was something I stayed away from, but being the director, producer, editor and cameraman allows you to make the films you want and that appealed. Winning the VOWS in my 3rd year was an indication I was on the right track. I look forward to the next 10 years.</p>

  <p>I&lsquo;ve worked with Vicki for 4 years now and she quickly established herself as a great addition to the team. Her eye for detail, cameracraft and friendly charm is a huge asset on the wedding day and her wedding films are stunning. She can work as single shooter on the day, backup 2nd shooter or work on the Marryoke team.</p>

  <h3>Clare Bungay &compfn; Marryoke Choreographer</h3>

  <p>Clare joined the team in 2006 and works solely on the Marryokes. The difference she has made from me saying &ldquo;do something&rdquo; to directing the Marryoke is immense and for the first time we have guests coming back wanting to do more. She generally works with Vicki which allows the main shooter to concentrate on the wedding.</p>

  <h3>Eric Moran &compfn; Drone Pilot</h3>

  <p>We had our own drone but it was essentially for our own use as a hobby. As we were about to go for the certified training we came across Eric. He is fully qualified and a drone expert - so much so that companies send him drones to evaluate. He has a range of drones and will shortly be investing in one fit for carrying DSLR cameras.</p>

  <h3>Benjamin Tang &compfn; Videographer</h3>

  <p>Beni has worked with us for 3 years now and has been another excellent find. He has his own film producing company but helps us out when possible and is a safe pair of hands to call upon. We look forward to working with him more in the future.</p>
