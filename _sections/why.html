  <p>You should hire a professional videographer for much the same reasons you use a professional wedding venue, dress supplier or limousine company. They have the skills and the experience.</p>
  <p>They've done it many times before, their product has been tested by previous customers, they're insured, they use quality equipment (with back-ups if something goes wrong)... They know what they're doing</p>
  <p><strong>Watch The Birdie</strong> has these skills and the experience necessary to professionally record and edit your wedding footage to the high standard you would expect.</p>
  <p>We film all forms of weddings including religious, humanist, registrar and civil partnerships, in all types of locations including castles, hotels, houses, marquees and clubs and over Scotland, including Fife, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Inverness.</p>
  <p>We're just a <a href="#contact">phone call or email</a> away...</p>
